# strfetch
A small (fetch?) program written in C using Neovim.

## About
I felt like it, so I made it.

strfetch prints a silly message along with your fetch, which can be default or custom.

I may allow multiple from a config file soon, but then the point of strfetch will die, so maybe a bash rewrite with this?

## Compile
Compilation for OS X and Linux. 

Requires a C compiler and basic headers. 

`chmod +x build.command`

`./build.command`

## Usage
`strfetch "<string>"`

Double quotes are required to cancel spaces.

Otherwise, go wild with your message.

The defaults can be changed, but if you delete some remember to change the amount or you can get nothing as a string!

# OS X support is mostly completed.
Used memory is currently unavailable and will be patched later. Besides that, no differences exist and the same file can be compiled.
